## Turso Connector

The Turso Data Connector allows for connecting to a libSQL database. This uses the [Typescript Data Connector SDK](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-sdk-typescript) and implements the [Data Connector Spec](https://github.com/hasura/ndc-spec). 

In order to use this connector you will need a Turso database setup. This connector currently only supports querying.
